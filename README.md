# Need for Spear by /dev/null

This game is developed by /dev/null team (see contributors), and it is final project for the Software Engineering
course (COMP302). The main objective on this project is to implement design patterns, obey the MVVM design and get used
to Agile Development.

While we were developing this game, we did not only wanted to practise what we have learned, but also we wanted to
create a such game that we will be enjoying while playing.

Furthermore, Need for Spear game is developed for educational purposes. We are publishing this project to contribute to
open source community.

# Additional Info

As a dev/null, we were using the private Git server as a version control system and most of our commits located on that
server.

Also, I was the team lead on this project. I have followed Agile Development phases: Requirements, Design and
Development for each sprint to perform task divisions between team members.

Special thanks to all my team members for their commitment on this project.
